========================

PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework,
consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built using the [.NET Command Line Interface](https://github.com/dotnet/cli).
PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows, Linux and OSX systems.
