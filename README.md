========================

PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management platform,
consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built
using the [.NET Command Line Interface](https://github.com/dotnet/cli).
PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to
automate administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows, Linux and OSX systems.

either [Linux](docs/building/linux.md), [Windows](docs/building/windows.md) or
[OSX](docs/building/osx.md) and are encouraged to review the
[contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for specific workflow, test
requirements and coding guidelines.

If you encounter issues, please consult the [known issues](docs/KNOWNISSUES.md)
